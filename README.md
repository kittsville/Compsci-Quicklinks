# Aberdeen University Computer Science Quicklinks

A simple page for accessing Computer Science resources. Each link cuts through the crap (navigating MyAberdeen and lengthy URLs) to take you straight to the correct resource.

Created to save a frustrated Computer Science student a few seconds.

This is based on [Quicklinks](https://github.com/kittsville/ABDN-Quicklinks).
